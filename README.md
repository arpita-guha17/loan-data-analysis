# Loan Data Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This project is an Excel-based dashboard for analyzing loan data.  
It tracks key metrics like:
- Total loans issued
- Approval vs rejection rates
- Delinquent / late payments
- Borrower segments and risk
- Trend over time

The goal is to help stakeholders quickly see portfolio health and identify high-risk areas.

## What I did
- Cleaned and structured raw loan data in Excel
- Created KPI cards for key numbers
- Built charts to visualize approval trends and late payments
- Added interactive slicers/filters for region, loan status, etc.

## Tools Used
